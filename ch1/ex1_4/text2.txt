And all my life I've prayed for someone like you
And I thank God that I, that I finally found you
All my life I've prayed for someone like you
And I hope that you feel the same way too
Yes, I pray that you do love me too
I said you're all that I'm thinking of, baby
Said, I promise to never fall in love with a stranger
You're all I'm thinking of, I praise the Lord above
For sending me your love, I cherish every hug
I really love you
And all my life, baby, baby, I've prayed for someone like you
And I thank God that I, that I finally found you, baby
All my life I've prayed for someone like you
And I hope that you feel the same way too
Yes, I pray that you do, love me
